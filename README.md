`poly` provides inference for a polymorphic type-system with extensible records and variants.

The type-system is an extension of [Hindley-Milner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley–Milner_type_system) based on Daan Leijen's paper: [Extensible Records with Scoped Labels (Microsoft Research)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/extensible-records-with-scoped-labels/).

The core of the implementation is based on an [OCaml library](https://github.com/tomprimozic/type-systems/) by Tom Primozic.

## Supported Features

* Extensible records and variants with scoped labels
* Generic type classes, constructor classes, and parametric overloading
* Limited/explicit (type class) subtyping with multiple inheritance
* Mutually-recursive (generic) function expressions within grouped let bindings
* Mutually-recursive (generic) data types
* Transparently aliased (generic) types
* Mutable references

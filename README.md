```

`poly` provides inference for a polymorphic type-system with extensible records and variants.

The type-system is an extension of Hindley-Milner based on Daan Leijen's paper: [Extensible Records with Scoped Labels (Microsoft Research)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/extensible-records-with-scoped-labels/).

The implementation is based on an [OCaml library](https://github.com/tomprimozic/type-systems/) by Tom Primozic.
